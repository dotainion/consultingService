In our experience, it would take most entrepreneurs a minimum of 500 hours to create comparable materials. If you choose to do it yourself, you are implicitly valuing your time at just $40 per hour. Surely, you can create more value per hour for your venture by focusing on your product, customers, and distribution channels!",
                    "Professionalism Adds Value: We can complete the same engagement in about 100 hours. This implies a rate of $200 per hour. You’re probably paying your CPA at least $200 per hour, your attorney at least $300 per hour, and your name-brand management consultant at least $450 per hour. Yet these are all essentially commodities: a good attorney is easy to find, but a good business planner is very rare. We believe that our experience and specialized skills are a bargain compared to the many other professional services you employ."

This is because by the time you have decided to hire us, we have already set aside time to work with you, and we may even have turned away other opportunities in order to provide you with the best possible experience. Subsequent payments are subject to a pro-rated refund if you choose to terminate the project before we have fully earned the subsequent payment. For example, suppose fees for your project are broken into three payments, each covering 20 hours of services. The initial payment covers the first 20 hours, and the second payment covers the next 20 hours. If you change your mind about the project after we have put a total of 30 hours into the project, you would be entitled to a refund for half of the second payment because we will only have earned 10 hours of it.`,
